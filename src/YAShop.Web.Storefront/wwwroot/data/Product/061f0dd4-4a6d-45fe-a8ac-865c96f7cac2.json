It can also be used for cutting turf to size when laying. The precision filed carbon steel blade glides through dead wood with ease and produces a clean and fast cut. Sharp, triple ground teeth allow for efficient cutting of wet and green live wood. It predominantly cuts on the back stroke to minimise effort required.</p> <p>The blade folds into the rubber, comfort grip handle for easy transport.
