Rotary hammers are used whenever the going gets tough. They hammer and drill into tough material such as stone and concrete. The impact pulses literally ""break down” the material, while the cutter eats into the material with its rotating movement and breaks it out. Rotary hammers are suitable for both demolition work and for pulling down or breaking off hard materials such as concrete, brick or stone. The rotary hammer delivers up to 2.6 joule to the tool and with its pneumatic impact mechanism it provides very good forward traction for a drilling capacity of up to 26 mm in concrete. There is a practical position switch for all functions, while the large soft grip surfaces ensure a firm hold and therefore safe handling. The rotary hammer is equipped with a continuous operation lock for comfortable and user-friendly operation and an SDS-plus tool chuck with semi-automatic function. For all its power, the electronic speed control ensures that the tool can be adjusted to each particular material and application, and for safety there is an overload slip coupling.

The rotary hammer delivers up to 2.6 joule to the tool and with its pneumatic impact mechanism it provides very good forward traction for a drilling capacity of up to 26 mm in concrete. There is a practical position switch for all functions, while the large soft grip surfaces ensure a firm hold and therefore safe handling. The rotary hammer is equipped with a continuous operation lock for comfortable and user-friendly operation and an SDS-plus tool chuck with semi-automatic function. For all its power, the electronic speed control ensures that the tool can be adjusted to each particular material and application, and for safety there is an overload slip coupling. The infinitely adjustable drilling depth stop is made of stable plastic. The product is supplied in a practical E-Box Basic transport and storage case.   Features   4 functions: drilling/hammer drilling/chiselling with & without fixing Overload slipping clutch for increased user safety One position switch for all functions Large softgrip surfaces for comfortable working Continuous running lock for pleasant and easy working.

Rotary hammers are used whenever the going gets tough. They hammer and drill into tough material such as stone and concrete. The impact pulses literally ""break down” the material, while the cutter eats into the material with its rotating movement and breaks it out. Rotary hammers are suitable for both demolition work and for pulling down or breaking off hard materials such as concrete, brick or stone. The rotary hammer delivers up to 2.6 joule to the tool and with its pneumatic impact mechanism it provides very good forward traction for a drilling capacity of up to 26 mm in concrete. There is a practical position switch for all functions, while the large soft grip surfaces ensure a firm hold and therefore safe handling. The rotary hammer is equipped with a continuous operation lock for comfortable and user-friendly operation and an SDS-plus tool chuck with semi-automatic function.

Rotary hammers are used whenever the going gets tough. They hammer and drill into tough material such as stone and concrete. The impact pulses literally ""break down” the material, while the cutter eats into the material with its rotating movement and breaks it out. Rotary hammers are suitable for both demolition work and for pulling down or breaking off hard materials such as concrete, brick or stone. The rotary hammer delivers up to 2.6 joule to the tool and with its pneumatic impact mechanism it provides very good forward traction for a drilling capacity of up to 26 mm in concrete.

This SuperBooster pack includes two 3.6 bar, single ended, universal (negative head) pumps from the Right Pump range. The pumps can be used to ‘split’ a pumped installation, with one pump used to boost the cold water pressure and the other to boost the hot water pressure.  Like the other pumps in the Right Pump range, SuperBooster packs use centrifugal technology to increase the water pressure in a gravity fed system. This method of boosting the water pressure is quieter and more flow efficient than other methods, which makes Right Pumps the best option for whole house applications.  A SuperBooster pack offers a great option for large homes supplied by gravity fed system, as two individual pumps deliver higher pressures across hot and cold water compared to a twin pump.  It is recommended to use a SuperBooster pack in a gravity fed system where the hot or cold water will regularly be used individually, such as when supplying cold water to an electric shower, as this prevents extended periods of ‘closed head running’, which happens when only one side of the pump is used.  The SuperBooster pack also provides greater flexibility during installation compared to a twin pump, as the pumps can be located separately, allowing one pump to be located near the cold water tank and the other near to the hot water cylinder.  Boost hot and cold water individually with two single ended pumps. Offers flexible solution so pumps can be located separately. Suitable for gravity-fed, positve and negative head installations. Delivers higher pressure compared to a twin pump.

Rotary hammers are used whenever the going gets tough. They hammer and drill into tough material such as stone and concrete. The impact pulses literally ""break down” the material, while the cutter eats into the material with its rotating movement and breaks it out. Rotary hammers are suitable for both demolition work and for pulling down or breaking off hard materials such as concrete, brick or stone. The rotary hammer delivers up to 2.6 joule to the tool and with its pneumatic impact mechanism it provides very good forward traction for a drilling capacity of up to 26 mm in concrete. There is a practical position switch for all functions, while the large soft grip surfaces ensure a firm hold and therefore safe handling. The rotary hammer is equipped with a continuous operation lock for comfortable and user-friendly operation and an SDS-plus tool chuck with semi-automatic function. For all its power, the electronic speed control ensures that the tool can be adjusted to each particular material and application, and for safety there is an overload slip coupling.

This method of boosting the water pressure is quieter and more flow efficient than other methods, which makes Right Pumps the best option for whole house applications.  It is recommended to use a SuperBooster pack in a gravity fed system where the hot or cold water will regularly be used individually, such as when supplying cold water to an electric shower, as this prevents extended periods of ‘closed head running’, which happens when only one side of the pump is used.   The SuperBooster pack also provides greater flexibility during installation compared to a twin pump, as the pumps can be located separately, allowing one pump to be located near the cold water tank and the other near to the hot water cylinder.   Boost hot and cold water individually with two single ended pumps. Offers flexible solution so pumps can be located separately. Suitable for gravity-fed, positve and negative head installations. Delivers higher pressure compared to a twin pump.  The RP80SU Right Shower Pump Replaces the ESP80 CPV, ESP80CPV The RP range of pumps from Salamander have been re-engineered from their already fantastic range of ESP, RHP, RSP RGP pumps to provide enhanced quality and reliability. The new benefits include a reduction in noise, the use of crossover technology to allow the former RSP shower only pumps to power the whole house, and the inclusion of a spiders web design to strengthen the plastic ends to further enhance strength, rigidity and reliability. Right pumps form our premium product range here at Salamander Pumps, offering the most powerful performance. Utilising centrifugal force, they are quieter and more flow efficient than regenerative pumps. The universal versions also have added technology that protects the pump from the ","https://shared1.ad-lister.co.uk/UserImages/fad77979-26e2-4ede-9f39-bdb242f0c51d/Img/shower pumps/RP80SU_SBMAT.jpg","https://shared1.ad-lister.co.uk/UserImages/fad77979-26e2-4ede-9f39-bdb242f0c51d/Img/shower pumps/RP80SU_SB.jpg","https://shared1.ad-lister.co.uk/UserImages/fad77979-26e2-4ede-9f39-bdb242f0c51d/Img/shower pumps/RP80SU_SBSpec.jpg","https://shared1.ad-lister.co.uk/UserImages/fad77979-26e2-4ede-9f39-bdb242f0c51d/Img/2023_01/rp80su.jpg","https://stbapmedia.blob.core.windows.net/imagessource/website_images/salamander-av-hose.jpg","https://stbapmedia.blob.core.windows.net/imagessource/2017_10/quietmark.jpg","https://stbapmedia.blob.core.windows.net/imagessource/2019_05/asp.jpg","https://stbapmedia.blob.core.windows.net/imagessource/2019_05/cro.jpg","https://stbapmedia.blob.core.windows.net/imagessource/2019_05/gravity-fed.jpg","https://stbapmedia.blob.core.windows.net/imagessource/2019_05/itere.jpg","https://stbapmedia.blob.core.windows.net/imagessource/2019_05/neg-v-pos-head.jpg","https://stbapmedia.blob.core.windows.net/imagessource/2019_05/nvr.jpg","https://stbapmedia.blob.core.windows.net/imagessource/2019_05/solidsate.jpg","https://stbapmedia.blob.core.windows.net/imagessource/2019_05/wras.jpg","","","","","","","","","","","1"
